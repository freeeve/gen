##Whatâ€™s this?

These are two [typewriter packages](https://github.com/clipperhouse/gen/typewriter) used in the implementation of [gen](https://github.com/clipperhouse/gen). Read more at those links.

If you'd like to develop your own typewriters, great! The [container package](https://github.com/clipperhouse/gen/typewriters/tree/master/container) is a decent template. (Still needs tests.)

The classic package is a bit convoluted due to early design decisions; probably not a good example for getting started. ;)
